# powerlessshutdown
Simple little script made in VBS which is meant for PCs without access to the Power Options. Namely ones controlled by Community Connect 4 or likewise.

Not intended for use on normal desktops, but if you don't like the Start menu for whatever reason then go ahead. I can't exactly tear through the screen.
Also not intended for hacking school/work computers, or a computer that you do NOT have admin on.

Includes quick access to the boot option screen with the Troubleshoot button, shutting down, and logging off if you can't do that.

_Note! You do not have to run the script as administrator! It will work anyway._
