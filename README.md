# powerlessshutdown
Simple little script made in VBS which is meant for PCs without access to the Power Options. Namely ones controlled by Community Connect 4 or likewise.

Not intended for use on normal desktops, but if you don't like the Start menu for whatever reason then go ahead. I can't exactly tear through the screen.
Please don't copy this!
